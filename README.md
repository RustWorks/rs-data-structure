## It's a Data Structure and Algorithm rust implementation for learning purpose.

A lot of code is copied or inspired from other crate or rust std.

### Code Structure
* algo
    * sort: almost all main sort algorithms' implementation
    * string
    * four color problem
    * josephus circle
    * maze
    * saddle point
* expr:
    prefix,infix and postfix expression evaluation
* graph:
    common graph implementation
* hash:
    a full copy from hashbrown, which is the new hash implementation in std
* tree
    * binary tree: basic binary tree
    * binary search tree
* deque: queue which is implemented in double linked list
* glist: general list
* heap
* list: single linked list
* vec: vector

### TODO
* B-Tree
* LSM Tree
* AVL Tree
* Trie
* LinkedHashMap
